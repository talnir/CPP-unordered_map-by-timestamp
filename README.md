# CPP-unordered_map-by-timestamp

Make a data structure that where you can add and get elements based on timestamp.

hash_map use a hash table where the key is hashed to a slot in the table and the value is stored in a list tied to that key.

An unordered_map should give slightly better performance for accessing known elements of the collection, but a map will have
additional useful characteristics (e.g. it is stored in sorted order, which allows traversal from start to finish). 
unordered_map will be faster on insert and delete than a map.


auto specifier (since C++11)
For variables, specifies that the type of the variable that is being declared will be automatically deduced from its initializer. For functions, specifies that the return type is a trailing return type or will be deduced from its return statements (since C++14). for non-type template parameters, specifies that the type will be deduced from the argument (since C++17)
